# Overview

This project was created for great 'real world' experience.

This software (moltair preview tool) displays an inputted image on the left side of the client, and allows the user to add text, choose fonts, and add pictures which then display as overlays on the first image (left panel).

The purpose of this software is to allow customers that are shopping for custom designs to be able to 'test' and 'preview' what they are buying, giving them a better sense of what the 'end product' will look like beforer they make a purchase of a 'custom stainless steel bottle'.

# Future Work

- Add different pricing variables for Line 1, Line2, Library Templates and Custom Templates
- Use woocommerce hooks to display product png
- Update woocommerce variables with hooks to display proper pricing and add preview and notes to final checkout so customer can proceed with order.
